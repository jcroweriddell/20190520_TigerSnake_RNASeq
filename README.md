## To do list
- [X] Upload data
- [ ] Trim reads
- [ ] Align transcripts
- [ ] Run Stringtie using ggf file for TS genome*
- [ ] DE analysis

*This accounts for transcripts that don't 'fit' & will output a gtf file
of each sample then create a combined gtf with location of those transcripts
We will have to manually inspect & adjust parameters, e.g. consider populations/individuals, multiple layers of merging... 

## Samples
TASMANIA = 5
MAINLAND = 5
REEVESBY = 5
FRANKLIN = 5
